## (Optional - useful for understanding the CDM model better) Setting up a synthetic data OMOP/CDM database for local development and testing

For setting up a full-blown OMOP/CDM database with Synthea data see
the steps at https://github.com/pieterlukasse/OHDSI-ETL-Synthea

:warning: this is useful for understanding the CDM schema better, but for now we only
really use a subset of this schema.
